         <h3>Titanfall 2</h3>
         <p>
            This is a video game unlike many I have played prior or since. You enter the role of Jack Cooper, a militia man for a rebel faction in the outer reaches of the solar system that is fighting for independence from a corporate overlord army bent on harvesting resources from the independent worlds and leaving them without the ability to survive. Training to be a titan pilot, you are thrust into the responsibility of picking up where your mentor left
            off when he is killed in the line of duty. Utilizing the brute force of a 40 ton walking tank and the speed and agility of the pilot-specific jump-kit
            Jack Cooper takes on the evil armada to save the planet and maybe help with the war.

         <h3>Nier:Automata</h3>
         <p>
            This is a game that needs to be experienced more than played. You play as two androids that a supposedly fighting for humanity to take back earth from an alien invasion, but end up on a journey of introspection, philosophy, and ultimately attempt to find the answer to what makes humanity so human. Is it possible for artificial intelligences to achieve this level of humanity? This game, despite initial appearances, deserves the title of masterpiece.

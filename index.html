               <h3>Titanfall 2</h3>
               <p>
                  This is a video game unlike many I have played prior or since. You enter the role of Jack Cooper, a
                  militia man for a rebel faction in the outer reaches of the solar system that is fighting for
                  independence from a corporate overlord army bent on harvesting resources from the independent worlds
                  and leaving them without the ability to survive. Training to be a titan pilot, you are thrust into the
                  responsibility of picking up where your mentor left
                  off when he is killed in the line of duty. Utilizing the brute force of a 40 ton walking tank and the
                  speed and agility of the pilot-specific jump-kit
                  Jack Cooper takes on the evil armada to save the planet and maybe help with the war.

               <h3>Nier:Automata</h3>
               <p>
                  This is a game that needs to be experienced more than played. You play as two androids that a
                  supposedly fighting for humanity to take back earth from an alien invasion, but end up on a journey of
                  introspection, philosophy, and ultimately attempt to find the answer to what makes humanity so human.
                  Is it possible for artificial intelligences to achieve this level of humanity? This game, despite
                  initial appearances, deserves the title of masterpiece.

               <h3>Half-Life Alyx</h3>
               <p>
                  This game is the knife edge of VR game design in my opinion. I binged this game in 2 sittings and there were points in the real world where my hands no longer felt real because they didn't match the hands that I had in the VR headset. Intense gunfights against human characters and worse that utilized my real-world body to take cover and land accurate shots while also giving a narrative story and experience will be hard to top in the coming years. This game is the proof that VR implementation is the way of the future for game developers, as long as they're willing to invest the resources for it.
